* In the PyBank challenge, I created a Python script for analyzing the financial records of my company. My financial data is drawn from a csv file (budget_data.csv). The dataset is composed of two columns: `Date` and `Profit/Losses`. I calculated the total number of months included in the dataset, the net total amount of profit/loss over the entire period (in this case: profit). I also calculated the average of the monthly changes, and found the month with the greatest increase in profits as well as the month with the greatest decrease in profits. The results print to the terminal and to an output file.


* In the PyPoll challenge, I helped a small, rural town modernize its vote-counting process. My election data is drawn from a csv file (election_data.csv). The dataset is composed of three columns: `Voter ID`, `County`, and `Candidate`. I created a Python script that finds the total number of votes cast based on voter-id, the complete list of candidates who received votes, and both the number of votes and percentage of votes that each candidate won. The script also determines the winner of the election based on popular vote. The results print to the terminal and to an output file.
